# Docstring Coverage Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of 100% docstring coverage for public APIs in the meal_planner project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Updates

#### `pyproject.toml`
- Added `"D"` to ruff's lint.select to enable docstring checking
- Configured Google-style docstrings as the standard
- Added exemptions for tests, alembic migrations, and scripts
- Exempted D105 (missing docstring in magic method) and D107 (missing docstring in __init__)

#### `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Added new `ruff-docstrings` hook to check docstring coverage
- Configured to run on pre-push stage

#### `.github/workflows/ci_cd.yml`
- Added "Check Docstring Coverage" step to CI pipeline
- Ensures all PRs have proper docstrings before merging

### 2. Documentation

#### `DOCSTRING_STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- Created comprehensive style guide with examples
- Covers modules, classes, functions, methods, and properties
- Includes good/bad examples and special cases
- Documents enforcement mechanisms

#### `README.md`
- Added "Code Quality Standards" section
- Documents docstring requirements and how to check locally
- Links to the style guide

### 3. Docstrings Added

Added comprehensive docstrings to all public APIs across the codebase:

#### Core Modules
- `meal_planner/models.py` - All classes and methods documented
- `meal_planner/database.py` - Database functions documented
- `meal_planner/core.py` - Module attributes and components documented
- `meal_planner/form_processing.py` - Form processing utilities documented

#### Services
- `meal_planner/services/call_llm.py` - LLM interaction functions documented
- `meal_planner/services/extract_webpage_text.py` - Web scraping utilities documented
- `meal_planner/services/process_recipe.py` - Recipe processing functions documented

#### API
- `meal_planner/api/recipes.py` - All REST endpoints documented with Args, Returns, Raises

#### Routers
- `meal_planner/routers/pages.py` - Page route handlers documented
- `meal_planner/routers/actions.py` - Action endpoints documented
- `meal_planner/routers/ui_fragments.py` - HTMX fragment endpoints documented

#### UI Components
- `meal_planner/ui/common.py` - Common UI utilities documented
- `meal_planner/ui/layout.py` - Layout components documented
- `meal_planner/ui/list_recipes.py` - Recipe list components documented
- `meal_planner/ui/extract_recipe.py` - Extraction form components documented
- `meal_planner/ui/edit_recipe.py` - Complex editing components documented

## Docstring Standards Applied

1. **Meaningful Content**: All docstrings explain the "why" and "how", not just restate the function signature
2. **Google Style**: Consistent use of Args, Returns, Raises, Note sections
3. **Type Information**: Docstrings complement type hints with additional context
4. **Examples**: Added usage examples where helpful
5. **Error Handling**: Documented all exceptions that can be raised

## Verification

To verify 100% docstring coverage:

```bash
# Check locally
uv run ruff check --select D .

# Or if using standard ruff
ruff check --select D meal_planner/
```

All public APIs now have comprehensive docstrings that provide value beyond the function signatures. The pre-commit hooks and CI pipeline will ensure this standard is maintained going forward.
