        "Honey Garlic Shrimp"
    ],
    "expected_ingredients": [
        "1/3 cup **honey**",
        "1/4 cup **soy sauce** (we usually use reduced sodium)",
        "2 **garlic cloves**, minced (or 1 teaspoon jarred minced **garlic**)",
        "1 lb medium uncooked **shrimp**, peeled & deveined",
        "2 teaspoons **olive oil**",
        "**optional:** 1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger",
        "**optional for garnish:** chopped green onion"
    ],
    "expected_instructions": [
        "Whisk the honey, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger (if using) together in a medium bowl. You will use half for the marinade in step 2 and half for cooking the shrimp in step 3.",
        "Place shrimp in a large sealable container or zipped-top bag. Pour 1/2 of the marinade/sauce mixture on top, give it all a shake or stir, then allow shrimp to marinate in the refrigerator for 15 minutes or for up to 8-12 hours. Cover and refrigerate the rest of the marinade for step 3. (Time-saving tip: while the shrimp is marinating, we usually steam broccoli and microwave some quick brown rice.)",
        "Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place shrimp in the skillet. (Discard used marinade.) Cook shrimp on one side until pink, about 45 seconds, then flip shrimp over. Pour in remaining marinade/sauce and cook it all until shrimp is cooked through, about 1-2 more minutes.",
        "Serve shrimp with cooked marinade sauce and a garnish of green onion. The sauce is excellent on brown rice and steamed vegetables on the side."
