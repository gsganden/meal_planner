        "Working with 1 breast at a time, hold a long knife parallel to cutting board and cut **2 medium skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 1 lb.), patted dry**, in half, slicing along a long side to make thin cutlets. Arrange all 4 cutlets in an even layer on cutting board and sprinkle all over with **2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1\u00bc tsp. Morton kosher salt**. Transfer to a medium bowl and sprinkle with **\u00bc cup all-purpose flour**; toss to coat.",
        "Heat **\u00bc cup extra-virgin olive oil** in a large high-sided ovenproof skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium. Working in 2 batches and adding more oil between batches if needed, lift cutlets from bowl, shaking off excess flour, and carefully lower into skillet. Cook until deep golden brown, about 3 minutes per side (chicken will finish cooking in oven). Transfer to a large plate or baking sheet.",
        "Reduce heat to medium-low. Add **8 garlic cloves, finely chopped**, and **\u00bd tsp. crushed red pepper flakes** to skillet and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add **one 28-oz. can whole peeled tomatoes**, crushing with your hands as you go, then add remaining **2\u00bc tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1\u00bc tsp. Morton kosher salt** and **1\u00bd tsp. sugar**. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Add **one 17.5-oz. package shelf-stable potato gnocchi** and cook, stirring constantly, until gnocchi is barely tender, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.",
        "Heat broiler. Arrange chicken in a single layer over gnocchi. Top chicken with **2 oz. Parmesan, finely grated**, followed by **8 oz. part-skim mozzarella, sliced \u00bc** \" **thick**. Transfer skillet to oven and broil until cheese is melted and browned, 5\u20138 minutes; watch closely to avoid burning.",
