    ],
    "expected_ingredients": [
        "180g pack peeled raw prawns roughly chopped",
        "4 skinless salmon fillets, chopped into small chunks",
        "3 spring onions roughly chopped",
        "1 lemon zested and juiced",
        "small pack coriander",
        "60g mayonnaise or Greek yogurt",
        "4 tsp chilli sauce (we used sriracha)",
        "2 Little Gem lettuces shredded",
        "1 cucumber peeled into ribbons",
        "1 tbsp olive oil",
        "4 seeded burger buns toasted, to serve"
    ],
    "expected_instructions": [
        "Briefly blitz half the prawns, half the salmon, the spring onions, lemon zest and half the coriander in a food processor until it forms a coarse paste. Tip into a bowl, stir in the rest of the prawns and salmon, season well and shape into four burgers. Chill for 10 mins.",
        "Mix the mayo and chilli sauce together in a small bowl, season and add some lemon juice to taste. Mix the lettuce with the cucumber, dress with a little of the remaining lemon juice and 1 tsp olive oil, then set aside.",
        "Heat the remaining oil in a large frying pan and fry the burgers for 3-4 mins each side or until they have a nice crust and the fish is cooked through. Serve with the salad on the side or in toasted burger buns, if you like, with a good dollop of the spicy mayo."
