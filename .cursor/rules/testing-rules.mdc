Run the following steps after completing a set of changes and address any issues they surface:
- Remove any code comments you have added (but not docstrings)
- Run `uv run ruff format`
- Run `uv run ruff check --fix`
- Run tests and check coverage. (Do not stop until test coverage is 100%.)
To run tests and check coverage, it is usually best to run `./run_fast_coverage.sh`. That script skips most of the slow tests that check LLM outputs. If we have made changes that might affect LLM outputs, use `source .env && uv run pytest --runslow` first.
We will use Modal to deploy the app (`uv run modal deploy deploy.py`) and run it locally (`uv run modal serve deploy.py`). It does not need to run outside Modal.
