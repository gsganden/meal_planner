Use `pre-commit run --hook-stage push` to check for issues after completing a set of changes.
To run tests and check coverage, it is usually best to run `./run_fast_coverage.sh`. That script skips most of the slow tests that check LLM outputs. If we have made changes that might affect LLM outputs, use `source .env && uv run pytest --cov=meal_planner --runslow` instead.
We will use Modal to deploy the app (`uv run modal deploy deploy.py`) and run it locally (`uv run modal serve deploy.py`). It does not need to run outside Modal.
