Given the following recipe:

$current_recipe_markdown

Please modify it according to this instruction: $modification_prompt

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE LLM:
- Focus ONLY on the requested modification ($modification_prompt).
- PRESERVE the original formatting, especially whitespace, list styles, and line breaks, wherever possible.
- DO NOT make unnecessary formatting changes.
- If the instructions are modified to use different ingredients, ensure the ingredients list accurately reflects the ingredients used in the modified instructions.
- When returning the `ingredients` and `instructions` lists in the JSON response, each string in those lists should contain ONLY the ingredient/instruction text itself, without any leading list indicators (like '-', '*', numbers, etc.).
- Return ONLY the modified recipe in the exact same JSON format (Recipe model: name, ingredients list, instructions list) as the input model.
