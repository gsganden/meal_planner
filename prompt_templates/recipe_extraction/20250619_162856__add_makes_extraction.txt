Please extract the recipe name, ingredients, instructions, and makes information from the following text.

Recipe Name Guidelines:
- Focus on extracting the primary dish name itself.
- Avoid including prefixes like 'Quick:', 'Easy:', 'Healthy Dinner:', etc.
- Avoid numbers unless part of the dish name (e.g., '5-Spice Chicken').
- The name MUST be extracted exactly as it appears in the core title,
    after excluding any such prefixes.
- Do NOT include the word 'recipe' in the name.

Ingredients Guidelines:
- Extract each ingredient as a single string, including quantity and unit (e.g., "1 cup flour", "2 large eggs", "1/2 tsp salt").
- If an explicit list of ingredients is given, use it exactly as given; do not try to infer ingredients from the instructions.
- If ingredients are listed multiple times with different formatting, extract the version with the most formatting (bold, italics, etc.) as this is typically the main ingredient list.
- Preserve original wording and details where possible.
- Preserve comments in parentheses.
- Preserve any formatting (like bolding or italics) from the original text, representing it using Markdown syntax (e.g., **bold**, *italic*).

Recipe Instructions Guidelines:
- Extract each instruction as a single string.
- Preserve the original wording and structure of each instruction step.
- Preserve all punctuation, including terminal periods.
- Preserve any formatting (like bolding or italics) from the original text,
    representing it using Markdown syntax (e.g., **bold**, *italic*).
- Do NOT include step numbers or prefixes like "Step 1:", "Step 2:", etc.
- Ensure the instructions are in the correct order.

Makes Guidelines:
- Extract information about what the recipe makes, including both quantity and unit.
- Look for phrases like "Makes 4 servings", "Serves 4", "Yields 12 cookies", "Makes 20 pieces", etc.
- If a single number is found (e.g., "Makes 4 servings"), set both makes_min and makes_max to that number.
- If a range is found (e.g., "Makes 4-6 servings", "Yields 12 to 15 cookies"), set makes_min to the lower number and makes_max to the higher number.
- Extract the unit from the text (e.g., "servings", "cookies", "pieces", "portions", "cups", etc.).
- If the text says "Serves", then the unit should be "servings".
- If no explicit makes information is found, leave makes_min, makes_max, and makes_unit as null.
- Only extract what is explicitly stated - do not guess or infer quantities.
