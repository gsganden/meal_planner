Please extract the recipe name and a list of ingredients from the
following HTML content.

Recipe Name Guidelines:
- Focus on extracting the primary dish name itself.
- Avoid including prefixes like 'Quick:', 'Easy:', 'Healthy Dinner:', etc.
- Avoid numbers unless part of the dish name (e.g., '5-Spice Chicken').
- The name MUST be extracted exactly as it appears in the core title,
    after excluding any such prefixes.
- Do NOT include the word 'recipe' in the name.

Ingredients Guidelines:
- Extract each ingredient as a single string, including quantity and unit.
- Preserve original wording (e.g., "6 large eggs", "1/4 cup mayonnaise").
- Discard any formatting (like bolding or italics) from the original text.

Recipe Instructions Guidelines:
- Extract each instruction as a single string.
- Preserve the original wording and structure of each instruction step.
- Ensure ALL punctuation, including trailing periods, is preserved exactly as it appears in the original text.
- Preserve any formatting (like bolding or italics) from the original text,
    representing it using Markdown syntax (e.g., **bold**, *italic*).
- Do NOT include step numbers or prefixes like "Step 1:", "Step 2:", etc.
- Ensure the instructions are in the correct order.
