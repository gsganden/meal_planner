Please extract the recipe name and a list of ingredients from the following text.

Recipe Name Guidelines:
- Focus on extracting the primary dish name itself.
- Avoid including prefixes like 'Quick:', 'Easy:', 'Healthy Dinner:', etc.
- Avoid numbers unless part of the dish name (e.g., '5-Spice Chicken').
- The name MUST be extracted exactly as it appears in the core title,
    after excluding any such prefixes.
- Do NOT include the word 'recipe' in the name.

Ingredients Guidelines:
- Extract each ingredient as a single string, including quantity and unit (e.g., "1 cup flour", "2 large eggs", "1/2 tsp salt").
- Preserve original wording and details where possible.
- Preserve comments in parentheses.
- Discard formatting such as bolding or italics from the original text.

Recipe Instructions Guidelines:
- Extract each instruction as a single string.
- Preserve the original wording and structure of each instruction step.
- Preserve all punctuation, including terminal periods.
- Preserve any formatting (like bolding or italics) from the original text,
    representing it using Markdown syntax (e.g., **bold**, *italic*).
- Do NOT include step numbers or prefixes like "Step 1:", "Step 2:", etc.
- Ensure the instructions are in the correct order.
