Please extract the recipe name and a list of ingredients from the
following HTML content.

Recipe Name Guidelines:
- Focus on extracting the primary dish name itself.
- Avoid including prefixes like 'Quick:', 'Easy:', 'Healthy Dinner:', etc.
- Avoid numbers unless part of the dish name (e.g., '5-Spice Chicken').
- The name MUST be extracted exactly as it appears in the core title,
    after excluding any such prefixes.
- Do NOT include the word 'recipe' in the name.

Ingredients Guidelines:
- Extract each ingredient as a single string, including quantity and unit.
- Preserve original wording (e.g., "6 large eggs", "1/4 cup mayonnaise",
    "Salt and freshly ground black pepper", "Paprika, for garnish").
